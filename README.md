# unikino-flyer
_The tool to upload the flyer on the website for lazy dudes (like me)._

For our local [Unikino](https://www.unikino.uni-halle.de/) I have to regulary upload the weekly flyer. They are the same steps every time:

1. Login
2. Upload Image
3. Rename Image
4. Go to the home page
5. replace the image (the image is always on the last site of the image selector)
6. set the text
7. publish

And this for every week. Always the same boring steps. Because I am to lazy for that stuff I need a different solution. And this repository will be the solution: A background programm triggered by a cronjob will always check if the newest flyer are online.

Perfect!
